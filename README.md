## Getting Started

Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/)

Install the IPCapture library by [Stefano Baldan](http://www.stefanobaldan.com/projects/ipcapture/)

_You can do that easily within Processing by going to Sketch - Import Library - Add Library and searching for IPCapture_

Download my examples and open them in Processing. The webcam version is well commented so you can figure things out, the other one not so much.
